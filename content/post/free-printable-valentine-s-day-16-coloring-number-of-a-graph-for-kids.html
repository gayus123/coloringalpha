                        In this video we define a (proper) vertex colouring of a graph and the chromatic number of a graph. A coloring of a graph g assigns a color to each vertex of g, with the restriction that two adjacent vertices never have the same color. The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we could also ask about coloring edges. In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color; In a few cases, it is possible to find very quickly the chromatic index of a graph, while it remains a tedious job to compute a corresponding coloring. § an improper coloring of a graph permits two adjacent vertices to be colored the same. Give every vertex a different color. All known algorithms for finding the chromatic number of a graph are some what inefficient.
