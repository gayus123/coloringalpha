    <p><strong>Easter 30+ Resistor Color Code Printable Chart , Free Easter 32+ Resistor Color Code Printable Chart  for Kids</strong>. If you&#039;re uncertain from which side of the resistor to read the colors, start with the side closest to the color stripe. Get resistor values from color bands and vice versa. The tolerance band is also easily identified due to the increased gap between the tolerance band and the multiplier band. The table can also be used to specify the color of the bands when the values are known. Reading resistor color codes is easy once you understand the meaning and the math behind each band used to indicate resistance value, tolerance we&#039;ve created a simple chart to explain resistor color coding for you.</p>

            <p>Resistor color code is used to indicate the resistance value. An automatic resistor calculator can be used to quickly find the resistor values. Here is the tutorial about 3, 4, 5 and 6 electronics for absolute beginners, chapter 2: The resistor conversion chart provide values for the 10k thermistors for the temperature versus resistance. The resistor color code chart give information on the standard resistance values, so a person studying from these charts can grasp the information easily.</p>

                        This physics video tutorial explains how to use the resistor color code chart to determine the value of the resistance of a resistor in an electric circuit. The resistor color code might seem a bit confusing and rather inconvenient at first, but most electronics hobbyists and technicians are surprised when they realize how quickly they&#039;ve memorized the color chart without the use of mnemonics or other silly shortcuts. The electronic color code is used to identify the values and tolerances of resistors. For a 4 band resistor color code, we can begin by first finding the tolerance band as it is usually gold or silver. This resistor has four bands. If you&#039;re uncertain from which side of the resistor to read the colors, start with the side closest to the color stripe. Some resistors have five stripes of color, with four representing the resistance value and the last one the tolerance. The table can also be used to specify the color of the bands when the values are known.
